# Software-Design-Drone-Project-

This Project was completed in my CS 420 Software Design Class, I was responsible for completing the AddIteam Container FXML and .java Files. This Code is not runnable from GitHub alone I had to exclude a .jar file that was included in the project, due to its large size.
